5-7/11/14
---------

Added many more unit tests.  Unit tests are now thorough.
A few more bug fixes found with new unit tests.
A few documentation updates.
Removed ability to specify cmp function in sort method, replaced with ability to specify key function.
Removed JSON encoder since it didn't behave consistantly between python2 and python3 and because it wasn't fully implemented.
Fixed sortTags() method in saveframe.

4/11/14
--------

Removed last bit of unit testing from bmrb.py and moved it to bmrb_test.
Added validation option when called directly.


3/11/14
--------

Added more unit tests.
Fixed bug in validate().

31/10/14
--------

Sans library updates:
    Converted sans code to run in python2 and python3.
    Improved ascii detection function.
    Converted print statements where errors were to sys.stderr.write statements
Test code updates:
    Moved sans and cif tests to unit_test folder
    Updated sans and cif tests to run in python 3

Fixed bug in addTag() method caused by getTag() changes in previous commit

30/10/14
--------

Began implementing full unit testing. Bugs found and corrected thus far:
    Gzipped files fetched from the internet were not decompressed
    Schema validation failed to catch when a tag's value was too many characters long

29/10/14
--------

Created python3 compatible sans3 files. (These are not fully ready for use. While they pass the basic tests they need further validation before being used in production.)
    Modified sans3 parser/lexer to decode btye objects to strings where necessary

bmrb.py
    Moved a few methods around that were in the wrong order
    Improvements to the way results are formatted in a loop's getTag method. (When only fetching one tag don't wrap the results in a list)
    Added depreciated getDataByTag() method back to loop to support legacy code
    Removed __cmp__ and replaced with __eq__ and __lt__ in entry, saveframe, and loop
    Made several changes to turn this into a python2/python3 polyglot
        Converted print functions to python3 style functions to minimize differences between python2 and 3 versions.
        Converted map functions to list comprehensions where applicable
        Modified sans module loading to check python version
        Added some python version detecting code where necessary


28/10/14
--------
Many changes to bmrb.py
    Replaced tags from ordered dictionary to list of lists. This was a massive change that required a big overhaul of many methods.
    Made all tags case insensitive.
    Replaced all string additions with string formatting methods.
    Improved code comments in several places
    Fixed several bugs
        __delitem__ had a bug under certain conditions in saveframe class
        addTag would allow the addition of tags with the wrong prefix without throwing an error
        Several other loop and saveframe methods had the same bug as addTag()
        Now entry, saveframe, and loop have identically behaving getTag() methods
    Reverted sortTags() to previous version that doesn't sort loops because loop sorting code was broken.
    Added svn version tracking to help function
